This is a placeholder for the favicon file.
In a production environment, this would be a 16x16 or 32x32 pixel ICO file.

For the CryptoDaily website, a suggested favicon would be:
- A simple coin shape with the letter "C" or "$" inside
- Dark blue color (#3a86ff) to match the site's theme
- Minimal design to maintain clarity at small sizes
